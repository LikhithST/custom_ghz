The `ghz` command line has numerous command line options.  You can run `ghz --help` to view all available options. 

<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

### `-proto`

The path to The Protocol Buffer .proto file for input.

### `-protoset`

Alternatively we use use compiled protoset file (containing compiled descriptors, produced by `protoc`) as input.
To create a protoset file, invoke `protoc` with the `*.proto` files that define the service. For example:

```sh
protoc --proto_path=. --descriptor_set_out=bundle.protoset *.proto
```

### `-call`

A fully-qualified method name in 'package/service/method' or 'package.service.method' format. For example: `helloworld.Greeter.SayHello`.

### `-cacert`

Path to the file containing trusted root certificates for verifying the server. By default `ghz` tries to create a secure connection using the system's default root certificate. The certificate file can be specified using `-cacert` option. The TLS verification can be skipped using `-skipTLS` option.

### `-cert`

Path to the file containing client certificate (public key), to present to the server. Must also provide `-key` option when this is used.

### `-key`

File containing client private key, to present to the server. Must also provide `-cert` option.

### `-cname`

Server name override when validating TLS certificate.

### `-skipTLS`

Skip TLS client verification of the server's certificate chain and host name.

### `-insecure`

Use plaintext and insecure connection.

### `-authority`

Value to be used as the `:authority` pseudo-header. Only works if `-insecure` is used.

### `-config`

Path to the JSON or TOML [config file](example_config.md) that specifies all the test settings.

### `-c`

Number of requests to run concurrently. Total number of requests cannot be smaller than the concurrency level. Default is `50`. For example to do requests in series without any concurrency set to `1`. 

### `-n`

The total number of requests to run. Default is `200`. The combination of `-c` and `-n` are critical in how the benchmarking is done. `ghz` takes the `-c` argument and spawns that make worker goroutines. In parallel these goroutines each do their share (`c / n`) requests. So for example with the default `-c 50 -n 200` options we would spawn `50` goroutines which in parallel each do `40` requests. 

### `-q`

Rate limit for each worker goroutine in queries per second (QPS). Default is no rate limit. This essentially spaces out the requests by adding a timeout to each worker before it attempts each call. 

### `-t`

Timeout for each request in seconds. Default is `20`, use 0 for infinite.

### `-z`

Duration of application to send requests. When duration is reached, application stops and exits. If duration is specified, `n` is ignored. Examples: `-z 10s` or `-z 3m`.

### `-x`

Maximum duration of application to send requests with `n` setting respected. If duration is reached before `n` requests are completed, application stops and exits. Examples: `-x 10s` or `-x 3m`.

### `-d`

The call data as stringified JSON. If the value is `@` then the request contents are read from standard input (stdin). Example: `-d '{"name":"Bob"}'`. For client streaming or bi-directional calls we can accept a JSON array of messages, and each element representing a single message within the stream call. For example: `-d '[{"name":"Joe"},{"name":"Kate"},{"name":"Sara"}]'` can be used as input for a client streaming call. In case of streaming calls if a single object is given for data then the it is sent as every message.

### `-D`

The path for call data JSON file. For example, `-D /home/user/file.json` or `-D ./file.json`.

### `-b`

The call data comes as serialized binary message read from standard input. See [writing a message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial#writing-a-message) on how to generate a bianry file for usage.

### `-B`

Path for the call data as serialized binary message.

### `-m`

Request metadata as stringified JSON.

### `-M`

Path for call metadata JSON file. For example, `-M /home/user/metadata.json` or `-M ./metadata.json`.

### `-o`

Output path. If none is provided by default we print to standard output (stdout).

### `-O`

Output type. If none provided, a summary is printed.

- `"csv"` - outputs the response metrics in comma-separated values format.
- `"json"` - outputs the metrics report in JSON format.
- `"pretty"` - outputs the metrics report in pretty JSON format.
- `"html"` - outputs the metrics report as HTML.
- `"influx-summary"` - outputs the metrics summary as InfluxDB line protocol.
- `"influx-details"` - outputs the metrics details as InfluxDB line protocol.

See [output formats page](output.md) for details.

### `-i`

Comma separated list of proto import paths. The current working directory and the directory of the protocol buffer file specified using `-proto` are automatically added to the import list.

### `-T`

Connection timeout in seconds for the initial connection dial. Default is `10`.

### `-L`

Keepalive time in seconds. Only used if present and above `0`.

### `-name`

A user specified name for the test.

### `-tags`

JSON string representation of user-defined string tags. This is mainly for reporting purpoces. For example `-tags '{"env":"staging","created by":"Joe Developer"}'`.

### `-cpus`

Number of used cpu cores to be used for the test. The default is the total number of logical CPUs on the local machine.

### `-v`

Print the version.
